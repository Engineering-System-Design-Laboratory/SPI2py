Problem Description: This is a demo problem

data:
  placeholder: placeholder

analysis:
  placeholder: placeholder

layout:

  # The number of random initial layouts and subsequent optimizations
  # Not currently used
  number of solutions: 1


optimization:

  # Solver
  # TODO Add more solvers
  solver: scipy.optimize.minimize

  # Method
  # TODO Add more methods
  method: trust-constr

  # TODO Specify objective function
  # TODO Specify constraint function

  # Tolerances between 1e-1 and 2.5e-1 solve within a reasonable time
  convergence tolerance: 2.5e-1

  # Specify whether to check for collision between specific pairs
  detect collision:
    components and components: true
    components and interconnects: true
    components and structures: false
    interconnects and interconnects: true
    interconnects and structures: false

  # 0 to 1; 0 means no collision, >0 means some collision
  collision tolerance:
    components and components: 0
    components and interconnects: 0.5
    components and structures: 0.5
    interconnects and interconnects: 0.5
    interconnects and structures: 0

results:

  # Output report
  Report Filename: report.json
  Log Filepath: logger.log

  # Animation
  Output GIF: false
  GIF Filename: geometric_optimization # TODO Change to GIF Filepath
  GIF: output.gif

  Visualization:

    # Value between 0 and 20
    # Corresponds to...
    resolution: 8

    # true or false; should the program generate a GIF?
    # Warning, generating GIFs increases the runtime




  Outputs:
